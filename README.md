# More Loops

### Challenges
1. Write a **FUNCTION** called `ninetyNineBottles` that console.logs the lyrics to [99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html). Hint: You should loop, but don't use an array. 
1. Write a function called `buildATree` that takes in a number and console.logs a tree made of asterisks. For example: 
``` 
buildATree(3);  
  
  *
 * *  
* * * 
```
``` 
buildATree(5);  
  
    *
   * *  
  * * * 
 * * * * 
* * * * *  
```
